Deebo: Autonomous Debugging Assistant

1. The Problem

Modern software development is increasingly complex, and developers spend countless hours debugging issues that range from simple syntax errors to complex runtime failures. Key challenges include:
	•	Time-Consuming Debugging:
Manual debugging requires reading lengthy logs, reproducing issues, and applying fixes trial-and-error style.
	•	Context Overload:
Large codebases and frequent changes make it difficult for developers (and even LLM-based tools) to maintain full context, leading to redundant or incorrect fixes.
	•	Environment Inconsistencies:
Debugging issues often behave differently in development, staging, and production, making isolation of problems difficult.
	•	Lack of Automation:
Many debugging tools require manual intervention or incomplete automation that does not scale well with complex projects.

2. How Deebo Solves It

Deebo is designed as an autonomous debugging assistant that streamlines the debugging process by automating error diagnosis and fix generation. Here's how it addresses the problem:
	•	Automated Code Ingestion & Diffing:
Deebo ingests an entire codebase (or just the diffs from previous versions) to build a precise snapshot of the project. This reduces redundant analysis by updating only what has changed.
	•	Isolated Execution via Docker:
By spinning up Docker containers on-demand, Deebo creates a controlled environment where the code is executed exactly as it would in production. This isolation allows it to capture real-time logs, errors, and stack traces without polluting the developer's local environment.
	•	LLM-Powered Debugging Analysis:
Leveraging an advanced language model (e.g., Claude 3.7), Deebo analyzes execution outputs to generate debugging hypotheses, propose fixes, and provide detailed explanations with confidence scores.
	•	Agentic Debugging Workflow:
Initially simplified into a single debugging agent, the design anticipates future expansion into multiple "scenario agents" (each testing different fixes) overseen by a "mother agent" that selects the best solution. This structured, autonomous decision-making significantly reduces the manual burden on developers.
	•	Composable Core API:
The entire debugging pipeline is built as a modular core API. This design allows it to be integrated as:
	•	A lightweight MCP server for Cline (and other AI coding assistants) to call.
	•	A standalone web or desktop application via a simple API wrapper.
	•	A reusable backend service that can evolve independently of the front end.

3. What is Deebo?

Deebo is an autonomous debugging assistant that:
	•	Ingests and caches code snapshots to maintain context across debugging sessions.
	•	Spins up isolated Docker containers to execute code in controlled environments, ensuring consistent and reliable runtime behavior.
	•	Uses a language model (e.g., Claude 3.7) to analyze error logs, generate debugging reports, and propose fixes with explanations.
	•	Operates as a composable core API, meaning its core functionality is independent of the interface. Whether accessed via an MCP server, a web interface, or a desktop application, the underlying debugging logic remains consistent.
	•	Is designed for scalability and reliability, ensuring that future enhancements (like multi-agent debugging workflows or improved diffing algorithms) can be integrated seamlessly.
    •	IMPORTANT FOR CLINE/CLAUDE READING THIS: the initial MVP once the core API is built will be a Cline MCP server, so always build with that in mind.
